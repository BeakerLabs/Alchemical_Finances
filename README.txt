Description / Purpose of the Project:
-------------------------------------
The project is designed to replace the use of Microsoft Excel for the purposes of tracking a users Personal Finances. It can be equated to a modern checkbook ledger of yesteryear. Intended to assist in balancing your finances
against the automated ledgers provided by your financial institutions. Beaker Labs has a philosophy that people understand their finances better when they interact with them rather than watch them. Requiring the user to manually
input transactions helps reinforce playing an active role in your financial life. Many people may feel this to be a tedious process, at least initially, however as you pay attention to your spending habits it will help you
contextualize and/or rationalize your habits. Reducing the tendency to pay for unused subscriptions, or rethink the frequency of small unnecessary purchases.

1. No 2nd/3rd party Data Mining of user information.
2. All Data is currently stored in the users possession.
3. No Automatically filled ledgers.
4. Ability to attached Invoices/Receipts to all transactions.
