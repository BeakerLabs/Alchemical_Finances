input transactions helps reinforce playing an active role in your financial life. Many people may feel this to be a tedious process, at least initially, however as you pay attention to your spending habits it will help you
contextualize and/or rationalize your habits. Reducing the tendency to pay for unused subscriptions, or rethink the frequency of small unnecessary purchases.

1. No 2nd/3rd party Data Mining of user information.
2. All Data is currently stored under the user's possession.
3. No Automatically filled ledgers.
4. Ability to attached Invoices/Receipts to all transactions.
