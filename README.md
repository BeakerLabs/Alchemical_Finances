This software is intended to be built with Pyside6. Currently, the software utilizes Pyside2 to operate with the Matplotlib module properly. This should be updated and reverted before the years end. As it appears Matpltlib version 3.5.0
should address the Pyside6 backend issues. Pyside2 and Pyside6 function under the LGPLv3.0 as it is built upon the Qt C++ framework in the same manner as Pyside6.

~~This software was built using Pyside6 from the Qt Company which is produced and distributed under the GNU LGPLv3.0 License, as such so is this program. This repository doesn't come with the Pyside6 Module. The best way
to obtain the software is there _python -m pip install Pyside6_ (or your systems variant.)~~

Description / Purpose of the Project:
-------------------------------------
The project is designed to replace the use of Microsoft Excel for the purposes of tracking a users Personal Finances. It can be equated to a modern checkbook ledger of yesteryear. Intended to assist in balancing your finances
against the automated ledgers provided by your financial institutions. Beaker Labs has a philosophy that people understand their finances better when they interact with them rather than watch them. Requiring the user to manually
input transactions helps reinforce playing an active role in your financial life. Many people may feel this to be a tedious process, at least initially, however as you pay attention to your spending habits it will help you
contextualize and/or rationalize your habits. Reducing the tendency to pay for unused subscriptions, or rethink the frequency of small unnecessary purchases.

1. No 2nd/3rd party Data Mining of user information.
2. All Data is currently stored under the user's possession.
3. No Automatically filled ledgers.
4. Ability to attached Invoices/Receipts to all transactions.
5. Future features are planned.
    * decreased latency in posting transactions on older large ledgers
    * transfer transaction tab
    * print account specific statement report
    * export data to .csv file(s)
    * **more to come**
