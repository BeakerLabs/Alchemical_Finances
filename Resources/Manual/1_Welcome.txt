<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>If this is your first time opening <em>Alchemical Finances</em>, please take a moment to review this manual to get acquainted with the user interface. This software is built to have some inherent flexibility to allow you to mold things to fit your unique accounting style. Do not feel restrained to use the presets as shown or described in this manual.</p>
<p>As a reminder, there is no option to import information from your financial institutions. This software represents an evolution of the manual personal finance ledger. Moving beyond clunky spreadsheets into something more refined with added functionality previously not possible. Such as the ability to attach digital copies of your receipts to each transaction.</p>
<h3><strong>Philosophy</strong><strong>:</strong></h3>
<p>Beaker Labs Inc believes that the best way to manage your finances is to interact with your accounts on a personal level, by manually tracking each transaction. This habit helps bring focused attention onto your spending. The act of manually inputting each transaction can feel tedious, but it helps you learn just how frequently you are making small mindless purchases throughout your day. &nbsp;Which can reinforce more thoughtful spending habits by combining purchases into fewer transactions or avoiding unnecessary single item splurges.</p>
<p>This is not to say, automated bill payment systems are bad. However, not tracking your incoming and outgoing transactions can create financial blind spots that can lead to trouble. Remember, a financial institution can only display transactions that they have processed. Systems like <em>Alchemical Finances</em> can help you plan ahead by adding pending transactions to see the trajectory of an account.</p>
<h3><strong>User Profile:</strong></h3>
<p>Prior to jumping into creating your first account ledger, please fill out your <strong><em>User Profile</em></strong>. Provide your name and email address. The profile tab will not close without that information. In a future update, the software will offer the ability to retrieve your password if forgotten. The plan is to have it sent by email based upon your profile information.</p>

<h3><strong>Subsequent Visits: </strong></h3>
