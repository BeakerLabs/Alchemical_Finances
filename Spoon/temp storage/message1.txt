Thank you for continuing to use Alchemical Finances for your personal finance needs. It is an honor to be able to provide a tool to assist you in your finance journal. 

As the software has recently launched there is not much in the way of news to report. However, as things continue to develop be sure to keep an eye on these welcome messages. 

Updates, fixes, known glitches, and general news will be shared here to be reviewed. If a glitch is not mentioned here, please let me know via the service email listed below. It will be addressed as soon as possible.

In the meantime be sure to check out the blog on www.BeakerLabs.com. I will be writing about a variety of different topics, including but not limited to: Tips and Tricks, Financial Literacy , Development updates, and Future Software Projects.

Your continued support in this endeavor to provide a high quality personal finance ledger, is greatly appreciated. I hope you stick around to see what comes next.
